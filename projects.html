      <h3>Ross School of Business 2019 Innovation Challenge</h3>
      <div class='Headerpic'></div>
      <p>- Led a group of 4 members to brainstorm a product
strategy of a consulting company that allows technology to be more inclusive for elders and pitched our idea to
a group of judges. Our team was tasked to create a product that would help solve an inclusivity issue within the issue. We picked the issue of lack of inclusivity within technology. Through the collection of data and analysis of the data, we decided to tackle the elderly and technology. We pitched a consulting company that is based on community efforts and partnerships with large technology companies in order to successfully help eliminate barriers the elder community has within technology.</p>

      <p>Challenge: Create an application that allows riders to connect with fellow riders. Include features that would drive continuous engagement.
Solution: Our team designed an application where riders can connect with each other riders through an interactive map and a social community. Allowing riders to rename their vehicles and post their trips as well as a gamification feature with challenges and leaderboards.</p>

  <div class="Turbovote">
      <h3>Turbovote Design Jam</h3>
      <div class='Headerpic2'></div>
      <p>Challenge: Support voter registration in transient populations like graduating students without requiring new online accounts and retaining personal information.
Our Solution: Create an application with dual-factor authentication where you enter your address and name and it checks the state's voter database solving issues with students not knowing whether they are registered to vote. We also integrated printable stamps from the app as well as mailing recourses addressing college student's lack of knowledge and access to the mailing system to register to vote.</p>
